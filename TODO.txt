BEING WORKED ON:

* Sprite code is a mess
    * take sprites from a single image spritesheet
    * graphics module makes portions of spritesheet avaialble as images
    * sprite rendering should be batched
    * use same batch to render sky, hills, feather meter?
    * probably remove 'recalc sprite stats' stuff, or at least stop having
      to load dummy images before being able to call it


REFACTOR:

* Level -> World or Arena
* move Application into its own module
* add new 'game' class owned by Application


FEATURES:

* Difficulty tuning
    * Player dies rather than losing feathers
    * zero lives = game over
    * successive waves contain more birds

* fullscreen mode

* HUD:
    * Score needn't contain the word 'score'
    * add lives remaining
    * feather meter. What is it for?

* packaging:
    Binary exe for Windows. Try cxfreeze.
    Check that our source distribution works out of the box on machines
        with python26. Should include all depencies except python itself.
    Binary exe for Mac

* Sound effects.
    enemy spawn: subdued quack
    enemy attacked: spluttering quacks
    player attacked: urgent spluttering quacks

* smarter enemies

* improve accuracy of collision detection
    Pixel perfect would be nice
    I wouldn't mind if things (esp birds) had to overlap a smidgeon before they
    were considered to collide. Better that than having a visible gap.

* Enemy behaviour
    Being attacked, should face and move away from the attacker.
        They can cruise faster
        They change altitude more rapidly:
        They change altitude more frequently.
        Can flap more frequently
        They flap when approaching from the side
        They chase feathers
        They run when attacked
        They dive when you are above them
        They flap away when you are far above them
    Current 'dive on you' behaviour needs work, it does not account for
    horizontal velocities, so a diving enemy will almost always miss.

* Combos
    * floating numbers on screen for point-scoring events
    * killing an enemy increments multiplier for a few seconds
    * display multiplier if it is >1
    * attacking an enemy increases duration of current multiplier

* Achievements

* Key to toggle music.
    Display this in the instructions.

* walking animation when landed
    walking should probably be slightly quicker and more responsive than
    gliding without flaps (but slower than flying with flaps)

* Platforms
    Would be nice
    But is a bunch of work.
    Affects collisions, behaviour, gameplay, graphics, etc.
    Are they worth it?

* High scores
    Displayed after user dies, until next game starts
    Persisted, in 'All Users/AppData' or equivalent

* wraparound without disappearing
    requires drawing things twice if they are off edge of screen


NOT BEING DONE

* Clouds
    Do nothing except float across the screen, obscuring what is behind them.
    These aren't as much value as platforms, but sure would be easy to code.
    Maybe introduce a new cloud every three waves

* Collecting feathers improves flap power - don't like this on reflection.
    It makes control of the player very icky if flap_power is a variable
    amount. (or at least I couldn't find the right combo of values)
    Plus, it makes balancing enemy AI harder if they have to account for
    variable flap power.
