* fix algorithm used to rotate bird sprites. Rotation is now more
prominent, while not going screwy at high velocities.

* Scale game speed by dt between frames. Fixes game being too fast or slow:
  + when vsync doesn't work, game was unplayably fast at 400fps
  + when computer is too slow for 60fps, make game playable at 30fps
  + when user monitor has different refresh rate from the expected 60fps

* Disable pyglet automatically redrawing window after every key, mouse
  or window event. Results in much less cpu wasted by many needless redraws
  and possibly smoother on-screen updates.

* py2exe 'ascii' mode removes encodings/unicode. Reduces exe size by 50k

* py2exe put library.zip, avbin and msvcr90.dll in 'lib' dir, less confusion
  for users over what to double-click to start the game

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

* rename top level script SinisterDucks.py (hence also .exe name)
* rename top level module 'gamelib' to 'sinisterducks'
