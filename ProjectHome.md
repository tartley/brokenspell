[PyWeek 9](http://www.pyweek.org/9/) team [Broken Spell](http://www.pyweek.org/e/BrokenSpell/) need a code repository. This is it.

A very simple game, with quacking.

To download, see the green 'featured downloads' area on the right of this page.

To play on Windows, download the 'SinisterDucks-x.x.x-**mswin**.zip' file, unzip it, and double-click the executable.

To play on Macs and Linux, you must run from source. Install Python and the other dependencies described in the README first, then download the 'SinisterDucks-x.x.x-**src**.zip' file, unzip it and run `python -O Sinister-Ducks.py`.

If it doesn't work for you for any reason, I'd **really love** to hear about it - tartley at tartley dot com.

See the [README](http://brokenspell.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.txt).
