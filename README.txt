DEPENDENCIES:
    
    If you're using a binary distribution all dependencies should be
    in place.

    If you've got the Python source you'll need to install these
    before running the game:

      Python 2.6: http://python.org/download/releases/2.6.2/
      Pyglet:     http://pyglet.org/download.html 
                  (try "easy_install pyglet")


RUNNING THE GAME (BINARY VERSION):

    If you're using the Linux binary distribution run the "run_game"
    executable. From the console this is simply:

      ./run_game               

    Double-clicking the icon for "run_game" from your favourite file
    manager should work too.


RUNNING THE GAME FROM SOURCE:

    On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

    Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

      python run_game.py

    A configuration file, config.ini, can be used to affect the
    game and workaround issues. See comments within.


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

    Instructions appear at the start of the game.

    Use M to toggle the music.

    Press Esc to exit.
