RUNNING THE GAME

    On Windows, download the windows binary version, and double-click
    'Sinister-Ducks.exe'.

    Otherwise, download the source, install the dependencies listed
    below, and then from a terminal, cd to the game directory and type:

        python -O Sinister-Ducks.py

    A configuration file, config.ini, can be used to affect the
    game and workaround issues. See comments within that file.


DEPENDENCIES
    
      Python 2.6:   http://python.org/download/releases/2.6.2/
      pyglet 1.1.3: http://pyglet.org/download.html 
      AVBin:        This is included with pyglet Windows (.msi) and Mac (.dmg)
                    binary installers, but if you installed pyglet from source
                    (.tar.gz or .zip, or easy_install) then you'll need to get
                    AVBin separately from here:
                    http://code.google.com/p/avbin/downloads/list


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

    Z to flap. Left and Right to steer.

    Attack the sinister ducks by colliding with them. Whichever bird is highest
    will win the fight - the loser will shed a feather. When out of feathers,
    a bird will plummet from the sky.
    
    Collecting feathers gives you points. Points are greatly increased by
    consecutive collection, without touching any other birds.

    You cannot collect your own feathers - although they all look much the
    same from a distance, huh?

    Use M to toggle the music.

    Press Esc to exit.
